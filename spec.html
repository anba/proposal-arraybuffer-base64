title: ArrayBuffer to/from Base64
stage: 0
contributors: Kevin Gibbons

<emu-clause id="sec-arraybuffer.prototype.toBase64">
  <h1>ArrayBuffer.prototype.toBase64 ( )</h1>
  <p>The following steps are taken:</p>
  <emu-alg>
    1. Let _O_ be the *this* value.
    1. Perform ? RequireInternalSlot(_O_, [[ArrayBufferData]]).
    1. If IsSharedArrayBuffer(_O_) is *true*, throw a *TypeError* exception.
    1. If IsDetachedBuffer(_O_) is *true*, throw a *TypeError* exception.
    1. Let _block_ be _O_.[[ArrayBufferData]].
    1. Let _outAscii_ be the sequence of code points which results from encoding the sequence of bytes which is _block_ according to the base64 encoding specified in section 4 of RFC 4648.
    1. Return CodePointsToString(_outAscii_).
    1. NOTE: CodePointsToString is used only because RFC 4648 does not produce a sequence of code units. Implementations may be able to produce an ECMAScript string directly.
  </emu-alg>
</emu-clause>
<emu-clause id="sec-arraybuffer.frombase64">
  <h1>ArrayBuffer.fromBase64 ( _arg_ )</h1>
  <p>The following steps are taken:</p>
  <emu-alg>
    1. If Type(_arg_) is Object, let _string_ be ? ToString(_arg_).
    1. NOTE: because `[` is not a valid base64 character, the Strings returned by %Object.prototype.toString% will produce a SyntaxError below. Implementations are encouraged to provide an informative error message in that situations.
    1. Else, if Type(_arg_) is not String, throw a TypeError exception.
    1. NOTE: The above step is included to prevent errors such as accidentally passing `null` and receiving an ArrayBuffer containing the bytes &laquo; 0x9e, 0xe9, 0x65 &raquo;.
    1. Else, let _string_ be _arg_.
    1. Let _characters_ be StringToCodePoints(_string_).
    1. NOTE: StringToCodePoints is used only because RFC 4648 does not produce a sequence of code units. Implementations may be able to base64-decode _string_ directly.
    1. If _characters_ cannot result from applying the base64 encoding specified in section 4 of RFC 4648 to some sequence of bytes, throw a SyntaxError exception.
    1. Let _bytes_ be the single sequence of bytes such that applying the base64 encoding specified in section 4 of RFC 4648 to that sequence would produce _characters_.
    1. Let _buffer_ be ? AllocateArrayBuffer(*this* value, the number of bytes in of _bytes_).
    1. TODO: using *this* above is annoying, but consistent with `Promise.resolve` etc. On the other hand, buffers are unusually low-level, so it may not be worth trying to be consistent.
    1. Set the value at each index of _buffer_.[[ArrayBufferData]] to the value at the corresponding index of _bytes_.
    1. Return _buffer_.
